                    <p class="what">While we officially tied the knot at Somerville City Hall in February, we're thrilled to celebrate with you all this October. Beyond our pizza party extravaganza, we wanted to share some of our favorite spots with you all: a much-loved brewery in Union Square, the movie theater a short walk from our home, the only decent bagel shop in the neighborhood (Boston does not have good bagels!). We're so happy to share a slice of our life with you all.</p>
